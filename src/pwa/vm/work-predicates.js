// `step`/`controller` raiser, never for `dispatch`). So `stepNeedsYou` can't infer this from
// `state` alone; it has to look at `drafts` directly, whoever raised it.
//
// Guarded by isTerminalStep: an ActionStep's `.failure` and `state` can disagree.
// `onStepFailed` (engine.ts) deliberately leaves an ActionStep's `state` untouched when it
// sets `.failure` ("action steps reach failure only through `.failure`" — only orchestrated
// steps get `state` forced to `'failed'`), and nothing prunes an ActionStep's `drafts` on
// failure the way settleOrchestratedStep does for a controller-owned step. So a draft raised
// before a later provisioning failure can stay `state: 'gate_pending_approval'` with an
// unapproved draft forever, on a step that's actually dead. The server's own `isTerminal()`
// guard in write-draft-runner.ts refuses accept/revise/deny against exactly this — mirroring
// it here (and in stepNeedsYou below) is what keeps the client from inviting a decision that
// will always answer 409, and from stealing the focus card from "Job failed / Retry".

// feedback and unparks the raiser so the session can redraft — so a predicate that stops at
// `approvedAt` keeps the job pinned in "Needs you" and keeps rendering an untouched approval
// card, replies and Accept/Propose/Deny and all, after the click. Nothing moved on screen and

// "no". Hiding a decision the user still owes is the one unrecoverable outcome here — the
// step sits parked forever with nothing on screen to act on — so anything this can't resolve
